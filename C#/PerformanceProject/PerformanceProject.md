##Performance Project
###This is a project that I created to be a quick way for doing some performance tests. In this way, probably I can isolated specific test cases and measure which could be the best option for writing a piece of code in larger projects.

1. StringBuilder VS String.Concat VS ++ (plusplus)

2. Queries with ToLower() VS String.Equals VS InstanceOfString.IndexOf
