# More about the projects

## Learning Projects 
    ### This is a compilated source codes from some courses from Pluralsight that I had the opportunity to practice. Most of these source codes are C#, but there also Javascript snippets. Below are some topics of what were presented.
        1. Concurrenct Collections
        2. Asynchronous operations
        3. Language Internals 
 ## Performance Project 
    ### This is a project that I created to be a quick way for doing some performance tests. In this way, probably I can isolated specific test cases and measure which could be the best option for writing a piece of code in larger projects.
        1. StringBuilder VS String.Concat VS ++ (plusplus)
        2. Queries with ToLower() VS String.Equals VS InstanceOfString.IndexOf

## Design Patterns (Net core and xUnit)
    ### This project is destinated for design patterns / GanfOfFour (GoF) codes. More detailed informations are inside it.
